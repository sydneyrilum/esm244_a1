## Introduction 

This report provides an exploratory overview of the association between survey respondents' self-identified political affiliation (either conservative or liberal) and whether they consider themself to be an environmentalist. The survey was conducted in August 2017 by Chelsea Batavia and Andrews Forest LTER to explore "Influences on charitable giving for conservation" and yielded 1,331 individual respondents (Andrews Forest LTER Site and C. Batavia 2019). A chi-square test for independence will be used to compare proportions/count data collected in the survey and determine whether or not there is an association between the variables studied. 

```{r}
# Read in the data and clean column names
survey <- read.csv(here("data", "conservation_survey.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

## Survey Results

```{r}
# Create a simplified version of the survey data that only keeps `ENV_ID` and `POL_OR` variables, and adds new column that bins pol_id into a binary response of "conservative" or "liberal"
envi_pol_survey <- survey %>% 
  select(env_id, pol_or) %>% 
  mutate(pol_id = case_when( 
    pol_or %in% c(1, 2, 3) ~ "Conservative",
    pol_or %in% c(5, 6, 7) ~ "Liberal")) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

**Table 1.** Counts and proportions of “liberal” and “conservative” survey respondents who responded “Yes”, “No” and “Unsure” to the statement “I consider myself an environmentalist.” Data: Andrews Forest LTER Site and C. Batavia (2019)
```{r}
# Create a table with both counts & proportions
envi_pol_counts <- envi_pol_survey %>% 
  tabyl(pol_id, env_id) 

# Add proportions to counts table
envi_pol_table <- envi_pol_counts %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  adorn_ns()

# Finalized counts and proportions table
envi_pol_table %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Political Affiliation", "Yes", "No", "Unsure")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered")
```

## Hypothesis Test Results and Analysis

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Use `column_to_rownames` to convert counts table to a contingency table (makes `pol_id` column entries into stored rownames)
survey_ct <- envi_pol_counts %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "pol_id")

# Chi-square test for independence: Is there an association between political affiliation (conservative or liberal-leaning) and if a person considers themself an environmentalist? 
survey_x2 <- chisq.test(survey_ct)
survey_x2

# Get the chi-square test results to call outputs in-line
survey_tidy <- tidy(survey_x2)
```

There is a significant association between political affiliation and whether a person considers themself an environmentalist ($\chi$^2^(`r survey_tidy$parameter`) = `r round(survey_tidy$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r format(survey_tidy$p.value, scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)`). Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between political affiliation and self-identified environmentalist view and accept the alternative hypothesis that these two variables are not independent of each other. A greater proportion of respondents with liberal affiliations self-identified as environmentalists (Yes: `r envi_pol_table[2,2]`, No: `r envi_pol_table[2,3]`) than respondents with conservative affiliations (Yes: `r envi_pol_table[1,2]`, No: `r envi_pol_table[1,3]`). Approximately half of the conservative respondents did not identify as an environmentalist, while half of the liberal respondents identified as an environmentalist. A small proportion of respondents were "unsure" of their environmentalist view (Conservatives: `r envi_pol_table[1,4]`, Liberals: `r envi_pol_table[2,4]`).
