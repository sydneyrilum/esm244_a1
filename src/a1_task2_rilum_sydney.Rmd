## Introduction 
1) A useful descriptive introductory summary (3 - 4 sentences) that helps the audience understand the data (include a citation as necessary) and what youâ€™ll be exploring

This report provides an exploratory ....
Principal components analysis is an ordination method allowing us to glean as much about our multivariate data as possible in a simplified number of dimensions. 

explore variable relationships and clustering by species in a PCA biplot.


## Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

2) All of your organized and well-annotated code (with warnings/messages suppressed) you wrote to wrangle data then run PCA, and to create a professional looking PCA biplot that appears (with a caption) in your knitted HTML

```{r}
# Read in .csv file and clean up data
world_envi <- read_csv(here("data", "world_env_vars.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

```


```{r}
# PCA
world_pca <- world_envi %>% 
  select(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm")) %>%  # keeps variables in mm units
  drop_na() %>% 
  scale() %>%  # values scaled
  prcomp() # makes data frame into a list of info

# Create a dataset that drops NAs but contains all 8 variables to add aesthetics to biplot, matches PCA dataset
world_complete <- world_envi %>% 
  drop_na(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm"))


# Create a biplot using autoplot (from ggfortify package)
autoplot(world_pca,
         data = world_complete,
         colour = 'species',
         loadings = TRUE,
         loadings.label = TRUE) + # shows loadings of each variable
  theme_minimal() # can customize just like ggplot


# autoplot(penguin_pca,
#         data = penguin_complete,
#         loadings = TRUE,
 #        colour = 'species',
  #       loadings.label = TRUE,
   #      loadings.colour = "black",
    #     loadings.label.colour = "black",
     #    loadings.label.vjust = -0.5
     #    ) +
#  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","purple","orange")) +
 # scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue","purple","orange")) +
  #theme_minimal()

# Variance explained by each PC
screeplot(world_pca, type = "lines")

# See the loadings (weighting for each principal component)
world_pca$rotation

```



## Summary
3) A brief summary (nicely formatted and professionally written bulletpoints are fine) highlighting some major takeaways from your PCA that can be gleaned from the biplot
